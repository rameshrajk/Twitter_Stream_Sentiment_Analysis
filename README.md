# Twitter_Stream_Sentiment_Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment of real-time streaming data from Twitter based on a chosen hashtag. First, the tweets are scraped and filtered for emojis and special characters, and the location metadata is converted to geolocation information using the geopy API. Then, each tweet's sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, is analyzed using the Natural Language Toolkit pre-trained model. Finally, the sentiment, location, and other metadata are sent as an index to Kibana and the data is visualized in a dashboard (a screenshot of my dashboard is included). The graphs change in real-time, as long as the stream is running and the index is being updated.
